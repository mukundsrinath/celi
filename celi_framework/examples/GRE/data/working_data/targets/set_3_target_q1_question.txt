### Analytical Writing
#### Sample Topic Directions
Plan and compose a response to the following issue. A response to any other issue will receive a score of zero. Make sure that you respond to the specific instructions and support your position on the issue with reasons and examples drawn from such areas as your reading, experience, observations, and/or academic studies.

In an actual test, trained G R E readers will read your response and evaluate its overall quality according to how well you do each of the following:

Respond to the specific instructions on the issue
Consider the complexities of the issue
Organize, develop, and express your ideas
Support your position with relevant reasons and/or examples
Control the elements of standard written English

Before you begin writing, you may want to think for a few minutes about the issue and the instructions and then plan your response. Be sure to develop your position fully and organize it coherently, but leave time to reread what you have written and make any revisions you think are necessary.

##### Sample Topic:
The best way for a society to prepare its young people for leadership in government, industry, or other fields is by instilling in them a sense of cooperation, not competition.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons or examples that could be used to challenge your position.
