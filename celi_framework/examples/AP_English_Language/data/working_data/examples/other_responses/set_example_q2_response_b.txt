The poet Rita Dove delivered a speech to her
graduating students at the University of Virginia at
Charlottesville on May 21, 2010. The purpose of the speech
was to give Dove a chance to state her wishes for
her graduating class. In order to convey her message, Dove
makes an appeal to her audience's emotions, besides some of her
own personal experiences, and says short sentences specifically
touching others.
To begin her speech, Dove makes a personal
connection with her audience full of her students. Dove says,
"Although I have given commencement speeches before, this
one is different; this is personal." By making this
statement, Dove is able to connect with her students
on a deeper level. The phrase "this is personal" shows
how much Dove truly cares for her students, and shows
how the students have impacted her life. Later in the
speech, Dove states, "as instead of advice, I will give you
wishes. Don't think of me as a cranky fairy godmother or
a wily genie." This statement establishes a personal
relationship between Dove and her students. It informs
her students that she will be there whenever they
need her, just like a "fairy godmother". Making personal
connections with the audience allows Dove to grasp their attention
and pay attention closer to what she is saying.
Throughout the speech, Dove uses her own personal
experiences and personal wishes to convey her message.
Dove clearly exhibits each of her wishes for her students in her
speech, and puts them in bold letters on paper. Dove
relates that she wishes her students "hunger," "hard work,"
and "uncertainty." After stating each of her wishes, Dove
elaborates on what she means by those words. The short
statements for each wish shows that these are Doveâ€™s main
concerns. Dove also uses personal experiences to convey her message.
She summarizes up the main idea of one of her conversations
with her dad and tells this to her students. By doing this,
she is passing down information that was useful to her in her
success. She wants nothing but the best for her students, and
shows that by giving out personal information.
Dove connects with her readers on different levels
to show that she cares for them and wants them
to succeed in whatever it is that they do once they leave
school.
