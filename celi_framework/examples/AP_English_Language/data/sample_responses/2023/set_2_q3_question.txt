Question 3

Suggested time—40 minutes
(This question counts as one-third of the total essay section score.)

In a 2018 interview about the importance of collaboration, then United States Representative Carlos Curbelo
stated: “If you’re trying to convince someone that they need to get involved in an issue or perhaps change their
thinking on an issue, trying to scare them is not always effective and can actually sow1 resentment.”
Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Curbelo’s claim about persuading others is
valid.
